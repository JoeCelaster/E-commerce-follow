## Milestone 7:
Login Authentication S

User Enters Credentials: The user provides their email/username and password on the login page.
Fetch User Data from Database: The backend retrieves the user record based on the provided email/username. If the user is not found, return an error: "User does not exist."
Compare Encrypted Passwords: Process the user's input password using the same hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt). Compare the resulting hash to the stored hashed password. If they match, the user is authenticated; if not, send an error.
Create Login Endpoint: Accept user credentials (email/username and password). Retrieve the corresponding user from the database.
Validate Password: Use bcrypt to hash the entered password. Compare it with the stored hashed password for authentication.
Return Response: If authentication is successful, generate and return a session/token. If authentication fails, return an error message.
